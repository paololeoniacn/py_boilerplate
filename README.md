# My Python Boilerplate

A minimal template to quickly start Python projects with best practices and easy setup.

## Features
- **main.py**: A basic Python script with error handling and colorized output.
- **requirements.txt**: Manage dependencies easily.
- **run.ps1**: Automates environment setup and runs the application with logs.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PowerShell (for running the script)

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_python_boilerplate.git
   cd my_python_boilerplate
   ```

2. Run the `run.ps1` script to set up and launch the application:
   ```powershell
   .\run.ps1
   ```

   - This script:
     - Creates a virtual environment (`venv`) if it doesn't exist.
     - Installs required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
     - Runs the application (`main.py`).

3. View the output:
   - If successful, youâ€™ll see a colorized "Hello, World!" message.
   - Any errors will be logged in red.
